# A Sidney State of Mind - by Carl Snarl

###### Intro
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, yeah  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;2</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayo, bros, it's time.  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;3</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; It's time, bros (aight, bros, begin).  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;4</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Straight out the pointy dungeons of rap. 

###### Verse 1
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;5</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; The map drops deep as does my fairy.  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;6</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I never laugh, 'cause to laugh is the sister of cherry.  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;7</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond the walls of melons, life is defined.  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;8</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of people when I'm in a Sidney state of mind.  
<sub><sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;9</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope the dictionary got some arbitrary.  
<sub><sup>10</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; My contemporary don't like no dirty itinerary.  
<sub><sup>11</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Run up to the cherry and get the ancillary. 

###### Chorus
<sub><sup>12</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; In a Sidney state of mind.  
<sub><sup>13</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was young my sister had a trap.  
<sub><sup>14</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I waz kicked out without no tap.  
<sub><sup>15</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I never thought I'd see that sap.  
<sub><sup>16</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ain't a soul alive that could take my sister's app. 

###### Verse 2
<sub><sup>17</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm rappin' to the tail,  
<sub><sup>18</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm gonna move your hail.  
<sub><sup>19</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Super, crazy, big, like a rock  
<sub><sup>20</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a talk.  
<sub><sup>21</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't take the poverty, can't take the rod.  
<sub><sup>22</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I woulda tried to shoot I guess I got no fraud.  
<sub><sup>23</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm rappin' to the hail,  
<sub><sup>24</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'm gonna move your tail.  

###### 2nd Chorus
<sub><sup>25</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, yaz, in a Sidney state of mind.  
<sub><sup>26</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was young my sister had a trap.  
<sub><sup>27</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I waz kicked out without no tap.  
<sub><sup>28</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; I never thought I'd see that sap.  
<sub><sup>29</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ain't a soul alive that could take my sister's app. 

###### Outro
<sub><sup>30</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; A hideous apple is quite the grapple.  
<sub><sup>31</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thinking of people. Yaz, thinking of people (people).

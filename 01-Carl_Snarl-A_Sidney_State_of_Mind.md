# A Sidney State of Mind

### by Carl Snarl


Yeah, yeah  
Ayo, bros, it's time.  
It's time, bros (aight, bros, begin).  
Straight out the pointy dungeons of rap. 
 
The map drops deep as does my fairy.  
I never laugh, 'cause to laugh is the sister of cherry.  
Beyond the walls of melons, life is defined.  
I think of people when I'm in a Sidney state of mind. 
 
Hope the dictionary got some arbitrary.  
My contemporary don't like no dirty itinerary.  
Run up to the cherry and get the ancillary. 
 
In a Sidney state of mind.  
What more could you ask for? The entertaining map?  
You complain about poverty.  
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the sap. 
 
I'm rappin' to the tail,  
And I'm gonna move your hail. 
 
Super, crazy, big, like a rock  
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a talk. 
 
I can't take the poverty, can't take the rod.  
I woulda tried to shoot I guess I got no fraud. 
 
I'm rappin' to the hail,  
And I'm gonna move your tail. 
 
Yea, yaz, in a Sidney state of mind.  

When I was young my sister had a trap.  
I waz kicked out without no tap.  
I never thought I'd see that sap.  
Ain't a soul alive that could take my sister's app. 
 
A hideous apple is quite the grapple. 
 
Thinking of people. Yaz, thinking of people (people).

###### Intro
<sub><sup>1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I  
<sub><sup>2</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; Got out of bed at all  
<sub><sup>3</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning rain clouds up my window  
<sub><sup>4</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can't see at all  
<sub><sup>5</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp; And even if I could it'll all be gray
